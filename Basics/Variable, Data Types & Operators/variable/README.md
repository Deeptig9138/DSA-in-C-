# C++ Variables
This README provides an overview of **variables** in C++. These fundamental concepts are crucial to understanding how C++ works and form the foundation for writing more complex programs.

### What is a Variable?
A **variable** is a storage location in memory that holds data, which can be changed during program execution. It is given a name (identifier) to reference the data stored in it.

### Declaring Variables
In C++, you must declare a variable before using it. The syntax for declaring a variable is:
```cpp
<data_type> <variable_name>;
```

### Example:
1. int age;
2. double salary;
3. char grade;

### Initializing Variables
Variables can also be initialized (assigned a value) at the time of declaration.

### Example:
1. int age = 25;
2. double salary = 45000.50;
3. char grade = 'A';
